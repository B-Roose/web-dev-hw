  At the rise of a new dawn
  Rose the children of the sun
  To inhabit a kingdom
  Augustly crowned in rock mass vast

  All lakes are sanctuaries
  Like covert nemetons
  All forests are hallowed
  Blest groves of an invictus tribe

  Nertom woloutom que (We are strong and we are rich)
  Etsi snis karamos-e (And we gladly are)

  Nertom woloutom que etsi snis (We are strong and we are rich)
  Emmos snis riyi emmos snis (We are free, that's what we are)
  Widomor-e Karamos-e (We know it and we love to know it)
  Emmos snis riyi emmos snis andometi (We are free and we are untamed)
  Nertom woloutom que etsi snis (We are strong and we are rich)
  Emmos snis riyi emmos snis (We are free, that's what we are)

  A kingliy tribe sublime
  Arose in it's golden time
  In a prosperous era
  The age primordial reign

  A horde of untameables
  Invincible armada
  A dashing bold host
  Of venturous fearnaughts
