    <h1>Homemade Miso Soup With Dashi</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <blockquote>This is a recipe for a basic, easy to make miso soup from
          scratch. All ingredients can be found at a local asian market or most
          natural foods stores. The recipe includes instructions to make the
          Dashi soup base and preparing the miso soup. It can easily be customized
          by adding fresh vegetables, tofu, mushrooms or fresh mullosks.
          <br />
          <p>This recipe makes approximately 4 servings of miso soup.
          <p>*<b>Note</b>: <i> Hard vegetable and mullosks must be added before
            boiling Dashi to properly cook them. Softer vegetable (such as greens,
            mushrooms or tofu) should be added after boiling.</i></p></blockquote>

            <li>4 cups Water</li>
            <li>20g Kombu (dried kelp)</li>
            <li>3 cups kastuobushi (dried bonito flakes)</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>For Miso Soup</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>4 cups Dashi</li>
            <li>Extras of your choice (vegetables, tofu, mushrooms, etc.)</li>
            <li>4-6 Tbs Miso</li>
            <li>1 green onion (chopped)</li>
          </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Making Dashi</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Clean the kombu with a damp paper towel (<b>Do Not Wash</b>),
              making sure to not remove the white substance on the surface. Soak
              the kombu in water for at least 30 minutes or overnight (preferred).</li>
            <li>Pour the kombu and water into a sauce pan and <i><b>SLOWLY</b></i> bring
              to a boil on medium-low heat. Just before boiling, remove the kombu
              as it become slimy and bitter if left in.</li>
            <li>Add the katsuobushi and simmer for 30-60 seconds. Turn off the
              heat and let steep for 10 mintues.
            <li>Strain the katsuobushi from the Dashi, it is now ready to use.</li>
          </ol>
       <h3>Making Miso Soup</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Add any hard vegetable or mullosks into Dashi before boiling to
              ensure they are properly cooked. Once boiling, reduce and simmer
              until tender (for mullosks, until shells are popped open).</li>
            <li>Add any soft ingredients after the Dashi is boiled.</li>
            <li>Add small amounts of Miso to taste at a time, generally 2 Tbs
              of Miso per 2 cups of Dashi. Place the Miso in a ladle and slowly
              add Dashi into the ladle to completely dissolve the Miso.</li>
            <li>Add chopped green onion and any other ingredients desired that
              do not require cooking (such as tofu, seaweed, etc.)</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
          </ol>
