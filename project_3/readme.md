# Project 3: Landing Page
1. Margins are relation of content to the browser, padding is the relation of content to the borders/other content and borders surround content.
2. The hardest task was getting the right position for content.
3. First I entered all content into the index. Then made the CSS style template and tweaked individual style elements to my liking.
